# 🚀 Proposed_Method Project - QUICK START GUIDE

## 📋 TOO MANY FILES? START HERE!

This project has many files, but you only need to run **ONE** of these:

### 🎯 **RECOMMENDED: Start with the Project Runner**
```bash
python run_project.py
```
This gives you a **menu** to choose what to run!

---

## 🏃‍♂️ **Quick Options (if you want to run directly):**

### 1️⃣ **Main Demo** (Start here!)
```bash
python p_md_demo.py
```
**What it does:** Shows 30 autonomous agents making decisions

### 2️⃣ **Research Validation** (For benchmarking)
```bash
python research_validation_framework.py
```
**What it does:** Generates comprehensive performance reports

### 3️⃣ **IoT Test** (For industrial integration)
```bash
python test_iot_integration.py
```
**What it does:** Tests real-time industrial IoT processing

## 📊 **What Each File Does:**

| File | Purpose | When to Run |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `run_project.py` | **Main runner with menu** | **Always start here!** |
| `p_md_demo.py` | Core demonstration | To see the system work |
| `research_validation_framework.py` | Benchmarking & reports | For performance validation |
| `test_iot_integration.py` | IoT testing | For industrial applications |
| `interactive_dashboard.py` | Web dashboard | For visual monitoring |
| `showcase_enhanced_features.py` | Advanced features | For detailed exploration |

---

## 🛠️ **Setup (if needed):**

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Or use the runner:**
   ```bash
   python run_project.py
   # Then choose option 8 (Install Dependencies)
   ```

---

## 🎯 **TLDR - Just run this:**
```bash
python run_project.py
```
**Then choose option 1 for the main demo!**

---

## 📁 **Ignore These Directories:**
- `__pycache__/` - Python cache files
- `logs/` - Log files
- `plots/` - Generated charts
- `output/` - Experiment results
- `runs/` - Training data
- `research_validation_results/` - Validation reports

**You only need to run the `.py` files in the root directory!**
