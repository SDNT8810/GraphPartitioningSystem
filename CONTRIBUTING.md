# Contributing to Graph Partitioning System

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Graph Partitioning System! This document outlines the process and guidelines for contributing to this research project.

## Project Overview

This project implements a self-partitioning graph framework for autonomous data management in distributed industrial multi-source data stream systems. Our implementation focuses on:

- Intelligent graph partitioning strategies (Spectral, Dynamic, Hybrid)
- Distributed agent-based decision making
- Performance optimization and benchmarking
- System resilience and recovery mechanisms

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run tests to ensure everything is set up correctly:
```bash
python -m pytest src/tests/
```

## Development Process

### 1. Branching Strategy
- `main`: Stable production code
- `develop`: Development branch for integrating features
- Feature branches: `feature/your-feature-name`
- Bugfix branches: `fix/issue-description`

### 2. Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Document classes and functions using docstrings
- Keep functions focused and modular

### 3. Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for new features
- Include benchmark tests for performance-critical components
- Maintain or improve code coverage (currently at 66%)
- Run the full test suite before submitting PRs:
```bash
python -m pytest src/tests/ -v
```

### 4. Documentation
- Update docstrings for modified code
- Add comments for complex algorithms
- Update README.md for new features or changes
- Document benchmark results and performance implications

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch from `develop`
2. Implement your changes with appropriate tests
3. Run the full test suite
4. Update documentation
5. Submit a PR with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Link to related issues
   - Benchmark results if performance-related
   - Documentation updates

### PR Review Criteria
- Clean, readable code
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Performance impact (if applicable)
- Documentation quality
- Alignment with project goals
